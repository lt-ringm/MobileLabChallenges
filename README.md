# MobileLabChallenges

Hello everyone! We have collected all the material needed for the **3 challenges** of the **Ringmaster Mobile Laboratory** in this repository.

The repository is structured as follows:

``` bash
│
├── challenge_1    <== first challenge materials
│
├── challenge_2    <== second challenge materials   
│
├── challenge_3    <== third challenge materials
│
└── README.md
```

Inside the challenge folders you will find the powerpoint presentation with the requirements to pass the challenge and additional material that you may need for that specific challenge!

> :warning: Challenge materials will be published in the directory when the challenge starts!

**Good Luck and Have Fun !**
